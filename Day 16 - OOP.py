OOP = Object Oriented Programming

A class is a blueprint to create an object

An attribute is a varible that is associated to on object

A constructor is a pod of the blueprint that allows us to specify what should happend when our object is being constructed
in python we use __init__(self) as  constructor, it is used to initialize the attributes
